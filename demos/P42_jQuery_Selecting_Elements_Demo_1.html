    <h1>An Excerpt</h1>
    <p class="story">
      I was born in 1910, in Paris. My father was a gentle, easy-going person,
      a salad of racial genes: a Swiss citizen, of mixed French and Austrian
      descent, with a dash of the Danube in his veins. I am going to pass around
      in a minute some lovely, glossy-blue picture-postcards. He owned a luxurious
      hotel on the Riviera. His father and two grandfathers had sold wine, jewels
      and silk, respectively. At thirty he married an English girl, daughter of
      Jerome Dunn, the alpinist, and granddaughter of two Dorset parsons, experts
      in obscure subjects--paleopedology and Aeolian harps, respectively.

      My very photogenic mother died in a freak accident (picnic, lightning) when
      I was three, and, save for a pocket of warmth in the darkest past, nothing of
      her subsists within the hollows and dells of memory, over which, if you can
      still stand my style (I am writing under observation), the sun of my infancy
      had set: surely, you all know those redolent remnants of day suspended, with
      the midges, about some hedge in bloom or suddenly entered and traversed by
      the rambler, at the bottom of a hill, in the summer dusk; a furry warmth,
      golden midges.

    <p class="story">
      My mother's elder sister, Sybil, whom a cousin of my father's had married and
      then neglected, served in my immediate family as a kind of unpaid governess and
      housekeeper. Somebody told me later that she had been in love with my father,
      and that he had lightheartedly taken advantage of it one rainy day and forgotten
      it by the time the weather cleared. I was extremely fond of her, despite the
      rigidity--the fatal rigidity--of some of her rules. Perhaps she wanted to make
      of me, in the fullness of time, a better widower than my father. Aunt Sybil had
      pink-rimmed azure eyes and a waxen complexion. She wrote poetry. She was poetically
      superstitious. She said she knew she would die soon after my sixteenth birthday,
      and did. Her husband, a great traveler in perfumes, spent most of his time in
      America, where eventually he founded a firm and acquired a bit of real estate.
