          'The sun was shining on the sea,
          <br>
          Shining with all his
          might:
          <br>
          He did his very best to make
          <br>
          The billows
          smooth and bright--
          <br>
          And this was odd, because it was
          <br>
          The middle of the night.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moon was shining sulkily,
          <br>
          Because she thought the sun
          <br>
          Had got no business to be there
          <br>
          After the day was done--
          <br>
          "It's very rude of him," she said,
          <br>
          "To come and spoil the
          fun!"
