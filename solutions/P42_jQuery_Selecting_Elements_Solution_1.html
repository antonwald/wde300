          'The sun was shining on the sea,
           Shining with all his might:
          He did his very best to make
           The billows smooth and bright—
          And this was odd, because it was
           The middle of the night.

        <pre class="subsequent">
          The moon was shining sulkily,
           Because she thought the sun
          Had got no business to be there
           After the day was done—
          "It's very rude of him," she said,
           "To come and spoil the fun!"

        <pre id="stanza3" class="subsequent">
          The sea was wet as wet could be,
           The sands were dry as dry.
          You could not see a cloud, because
           No cloud was in the sky:
          No birds were flying over head—
           There were no birds to fly.
