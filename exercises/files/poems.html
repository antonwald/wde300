  <pre id="Jabberwocky">
     Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
       Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
     All mimsy were the borogoves,
       And the mome raths outgrabe.

  <pre id="Tweedledum">
    Tweedledum and Tweedledee
      Agreed to have a battle;
    For Tweedledum said Tweedledee
      Had spoiled his nice new rattle.

    Just then flew down a monstrous crow,
      As black as a tar-barrel;
    Which frightened both the heroes so,
      They quite forgot their quarrel.

 <pre id="Unicorn">
    The lion and the unicorn
    Were fighting for the crown
    The lion beat the unicorn
    All around the town.

  <pre id="Carpenter">
    The sun was shining on the sea,
    Shining with all his might:
    He did his very best to make
    The billows smooth and bright—
    And this was odd, because it was
    The middle of the night.

    The moon was shining sulkily,
    Because she thought the sun
    Had got no business to be there
    After the day was done—
    "It's very rude of him," she said,
    "To come and spoil the fun!"
