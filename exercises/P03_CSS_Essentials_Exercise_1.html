		<h3>JABBERWOCKY</h3>

		<p id="first">
			Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br />
			Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br>
			All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
			And the mome raths outgrabe.<br>
		</p>
		<p class="strange">
			'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br>
			The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
			Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
			The frumious Bandersnatch!'<br>
		</p>
		<p class="strange">
			He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br>
			Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ€”<br>
			So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br>
			And stood awhile in thought.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			And as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
			The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>
			Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
			And <span>burbled</span> as it came!<br>
		</p>
